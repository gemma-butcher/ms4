### Javascript
- During development of js code and using JS Hint to verify the code, there were a few error coming up. However this is due to Django syntax being used within the script which js hint doesnt recognise or
take into consideration. However i feel it is best practice to move the script into a seperate js file for the newsletter and for any further js scripts needed for the project, which will limit any console errors.
The JS errors are shown below.
